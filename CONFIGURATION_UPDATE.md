# Configuration Update Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. ✅ Free Tier API Key Configured

**API Key Set**: `[Your API key - stored in backend/.env]`

**Location**: `backend/.env`

> ⚠️ **Security Note**: The actual API key is stored in `backend/.env` which is not committed to git.

### 2. ✅ Changed to Total Request Limit

**Before**: 10 requests per hour (with automatic reset)
**After**: 10 requests total (lifetime limit per IP)

**Reason**: Users without their own API key can only make 10 total calls

### 3. ✅ Switched to Claude Haiku Model

**Before**: `claude-sonnet-4-20250514` (Claude Sonnet 4)
**After**: `claude-3-5-haiku-20241022` (Claude 3.5 Haiku)

**Benefits**:
- Much faster responses
- Lower cost (~$0.001 per request vs ~$0.015)
- Still high quality for the use case

## Technical Changes

### Backend (`backend/server.js`)

#### Rate Limiting System
```javascript
// OLD: Time-based reset
const SHARED_KEY_LIMIT = 10; // requests per hour per IP
const SHARED_KEY_RESET = 3600000; // 1 hour in ms

// NEW: Total lifetime limit
const SHARED_KEY_LIMIT = 10; // TOTAL requests per IP (lifetime)
// No reset time needed
```

#### Rate Check Function
```javascript
// OLD: Tracks count and reset time
{ count: X, resetTime: timestamp }

// NEW: Only tracks total count
{ count: X }
```

#### Error Messages
```javascript
// OLD
"Rate limit resets in X minutes"

// NEW
"You've used all 10 free requests"
```

#### Model Selection
```javascript
// OLD
model: 'claude-sonnet-4-20250514'

// NEW
model: 'claude-3-5-haiku-20241022'
```

### Frontend Updates

#### `frontend/src/App.jsx`

**Onboarding (Step 4)**
```javascript
// OLD
"10 AI requests per hour"
"Rate limits reset every hour"

// NEW
"10 AI requests total"
"Total lifetime limit - no reset"
```

**Dashboard Status**
```javascript
// OLD
"X/10 requests remaining (resets in Y min)"

// NEW
"X/10 requests remaining (total lifetime limit)"
```

**Conversation View Banner**
```javascript
// OLD
"Resets in X minutes"

// NEW
"Total lifetime limit"
```

#### `frontend/src/ApiKeyModal.jsx`

**Free Tier Info**
```javascript
// OLD
"10 AI requests per hour"
"Resets in X minutes"

// NEW
"10 AI requests total"
"Total lifetime limit"
```

**Limit Reached Message**
```javascript
// OLD
"Wait X minutes or add API key"

// NEW
"Add your own API key to continue"
```

## User Experience Changes

### Before
```
User Journey:
1. Use app without API key
2. Make 10 requests in an hour
3. Hit limit → Wait for reset
4. Hour passes → Get 10 more requests
5. Repeat indefinitely
```

### After
```
User Journey:
1. Use app without API key
2. Make 10 requests total
3. Hit limit → MUST add own API key
4. No reset, no more free requests
5. Decision: Add key or stop using
```

---

## Benefits of Changes

### 1. Cost Control ✅
- **Before**: Unlimited usage over time (10/hour = 240/day = 7,200/month)
- **After**: Maximum 10 requests per unique IP ever
- **Savings**: Dramatic reduction in free tier costs

### 2. Faster Responses ✅
- **Haiku vs Sonnet**: ~3-5x faster response times
- Better user experience
- Lower latency

### 3. Lower Per-Request Cost ✅
- **Sonnet**: ~$0.015 per request
- **Haiku**: ~$0.001 per request
- **Savings**: ~93% cost reduction per request

### 4. Clear User Expectations ✅
- Users know they have 10 total tries
- No confusion about resets
- Clear path to unlimited (add own key)

---

## Cost Analysis

### Free Tier Cost (Your Cost)

**With Sonnet (Before)**:
- 10 requests/hour × 24 hours × 30 days = 7,200 requests/month
- Cost: 7,200 × $0.015 = **$108/month**

**With Haiku + 10 Total Limit (After)**:
- Maximum theoretical: All IPs use 10 requests
- Even with 1,000 unique users: 1,000 × 10 = 10,000 requests
- Cost: 10,000 × $0.001 = **$10 total** (one-time)
- More realistic (100 users): **$1 total**

### User Costs (Their Own Key)

**With Sonnet**:
- Typical conversation: 5-10 requests
- Cost per conversation: $0.075-$0.15

**With Haiku**:
- Typical conversation: 5-10 requests
- Cost per conversation: $0.005-$0.01
- **~95% cheaper for users**

## Testing Checklist

### Backend Testing
```bash
# Start backend
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev

# Should see:
# "Shared API Key configured: Yes"
# "Backend server running on port 3001"
```

### Frontend Testing
```bash
# Start frontend
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev

# Test scenarios:
# 1. Go through onboarding
#    → Should say "10 AI requests total"
# 2. Make 9 requests
#    → Should show "1/10 remaining"
# 3. Make 10th request
#    → Should still work
# 4. Try 11th request
#    → Should show modal: "You've used all 10 free requests"
# 5. Add own API key
#    → Should work unlimited
```

### What to Verify

- [ ] Onboarding says "10 total" not "per hour"
- [ ] Dashboard shows total limit
- [ ] Conversation banner shows "Total lifetime limit"
- [ ] After 10 requests, modal appears
- [ ] Modal says "Add API key to continue" (no reset time)
- [ ] Own API key works unlimited
- [ ] Responses are faster (Haiku)

## Deployment Notes

### Environment Variables

**Production Backend (.env or Render settings)**:
```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_free_tier_api_key_here
PORT=3001
```

**Security Note**: The API key is committed to `.env` for development. For production:
- Set as environment variable in Render
- Do NOT commit production .env to git
- Consider using `.gitignore` for `.env`

### Model Availability

Claude 3.5 Haiku (`claude-3-5-haiku-20241022`) should be available in your Anthropic account. If not:
- Check Anthropic console for model access
- Contact Anthropic support if needed
- Fallback: Use `claude-3-haiku-20240307` (older Haiku)

---

## Monitoring

### Backend Logs to Watch

```bash
# Success logs
"Using shared key - Remaining: X requests"
"Daily cost: $X.XXX"
"Using user-provided API key"

# Limit reached
"Free tier limit reached"
```

### Anthropic Console

Monitor:
- Total requests (should be low now)
- Total cost (should be very low)
- Model usage (should show Haiku)

### Expected Patterns

**Good Patterns**:
- Most IPs use 1-5 requests (testing)
- Some IPs hit 10 (genuine interest)
- Those users add their own key

**Bad Patterns** (unlikely now):
- Same IP repeatedly hitting limit (can't happen)
- High costs (much lower with Haiku)

---

## Migration Path for Existing Users

### Users Who Haven't Hit Limit
- See new messaging about total limit
- Understand they have X remaining out of 10

### Users Currently Using Free Tier
- If they've used < 10 requests: Continue
- If they've used > 10 requests: Will hit limit soon
- Clear path to add own key

### Communication
Consider notifying users:
- "Free tier is now 10 total requests (was per-hour)"
- "We switched to faster model (Haiku)"
- "Add your own key for unlimited access"

---

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise:

```bash
# 1. Revert backend
git checkout <previous-commit> -- backend/server.js

# 2. Revert frontend
git checkout <previous-commit> -- frontend/src/App.jsx
git checkout <previous-commit> -- frontend/src/ApiKeyModal.jsx

# 3. Change model back
# In server.js, change:
model: 'claude-3-5-haiku-20241022'
# To:
model: 'claude-sonnet-4-20250514'

# 4. Redeploy
```

---

## Summary

✅ **Free tier API key**: Configured
✅ **Limit changed**: 10 total requests (not per hour)
✅ **Model switched**: Claude 3.5 Haiku (faster, cheaper)
✅ **UI updated**: All references to "per hour" → "total"
✅ **Error messages**: Updated to remove reset time
✅ **Cost impact**: Dramatically reduced

**Status**: Ready to test and deploy!
