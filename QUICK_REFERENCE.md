# Quick Reference - AI Thinking Partner Mockup# Quick Reference - AI Thinking Partner Mockup# âœ… Configuration Complete - Quick Reference



## What This Is

A UI mockup demonstrating an AI thinking partner tool concept for people with ADHD. The tool is designed to help break the pattern of starting-and-abandoning projects through challenging Socratic questioning.

## Running the Mockup

A UI mockup demonstrating an AI thinking partner tool concept for people with ADHD. The tool is designed to help break the pattern of starting-and-abandoning projects through challenging Socratic questioning.

### Local Development

```bash### 1. ðŸ”‘ API Key Set

cd frontend

npm install## Running the Mockup```

npm run dev

``````bashFree Tier Key: [Stored in backend/.env]

Visit `http://localhost:5173`

cd frontendLocation: backend/.env

### Deploy to Render

1. Fork this repositorynpm install```

2. Connect to Render.com as a Static Site

3. Render auto-detects configuration from `render.yaml`npm run dev

4. Deploy automatically!

```### 2. ðŸ“Š Limit Changed

**Build settings** (if configuring manually):

- Build Command: `cd frontend && npm install && npm run build`Visit `http://localhost:5173````

- Publish Directory: `frontend/dist`

Before: 10 requests/hour (resets every hour)

## Key Features (Mockup)

- **Onboarding Flow**: Gather user patterns and facts## Key Features (Mockup)After:  10 requests TOTAL (lifetime per IP)

- **Project Tracking**: Definition of Done, progress notes, status tracking

- **AI Conversations**: Simulated responses that challenge and guide thinking- **Onboarding Flow**: Gather user patterns and facts```

- **Facts Database**: Personal patterns and context

- **Daily Check-ins**: Pattern recognition and accountability- **Project Tracking**: Definition of Done, progress notes, status tracking



## Demo Flow- **AI Conversations**: Simulated responses that challenge and guide thinking### 3. ðŸš€ Model Changed

1. Start onboarding (enter any name)

2. Skip API key setup (demo mode)- **Facts Database**: Personal patterns and context```

3. Explore dashboard with sample projects

4. Try "Start New Thought" for simulated conversation- **Daily Check-ins**: Pattern recognition and accountabilityBefore: Claude Sonnet 4 (claude-sonnet-4-20250514)

5. View projects list and facts management

After:  Claude 3.5 Haiku (claude-3-5-haiku-20241022)

## Why This Approach

Built to recognize and address ADHD patterns:## Demo Flow

- Novelty-seeking over finishing projects

- Credential-chasing when triggered1. Start onboarding (enter any name)Benefits:

- Need for external accountability

- Difficulty defining "done"2. Skip API key setup (demo mode)- 3-5x faster responses



## Project Status3. Explore dashboard with sample projects- ~93% cost reduction ($0.001 vs $0.015)

**Scaled back to mockup only.** While building this, I recognized I was doing exactly what it was designed to prevent - starting a new project instead of finishing existing ones. Sometimes the most valuable outcome is recognizing the pattern before you're too deep in it.

4. Try "Start New Thought" for simulated conversation- Still high quality

## For Implementation

The UI mockup provides a foundation for someone who wants to build this properly with real AI integration. All the UX patterns and flows are demonstrated.5. View projects list and facts management```



## Why This Approach---

Built to recognize and address ADHD patterns:

- Novelty-seeking over finishing projects## Files Modified

- Credential-chasing when triggered

- Need for external accountabilityâœ… `backend/server.js` - Rate limit logic + model

- Difficulty defining "done"âœ… `backend/.env` - API key configured  

âœ… `backend/.env.example` - Updated comment

## Project Statusâœ… `frontend/src/App.jsx` - UI text + model

**Scaled back to mockup only.** While building this, I recognized I was doing exactly what it was designed to prevent - starting a new project instead of finishing existing ones. Sometimes the most valuable outcome is recognizing the pattern before you're too deep in it.âœ… `frontend/src/ApiKeyModal.jsx` - Modal text



## For Implementation---

The UI mockup provides a foundation for someone who wants to build this properly with real AI integration. All the UX patterns and flows are demonstrated.
## User Experience

### Free Tier Users
- Get 10 total requests (not per hour)
- No time-based reset
- Must add own key after 10 requests
- Faster responses with Haiku

### Own Key Users
- Unlimited requests
- ~95% cheaper per conversation
- Same unlimited experience

---

## Cost Impact

### Before (Sonnet + Hourly Reset)
```
Potential: 7,200 requests/month per IP
Cost: ~$108/month per active IP
Risk: Unlimited usage over time
```

### After (Haiku + Total Limit)
```
Maximum: 10 requests per IP ever
Cost: ~$0.01 per IP total
Savings: ~99.9% reduction
```

---

## Testing Steps

### 1. Start Backend
```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev
# Should start on port 3001
```

### 2. Start Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
# Should start on port 5173
```

### 3. Test Free Tier
1. Go through onboarding
2. See "10 AI requests total" (not "per hour")
3. Make 9 requests â†’ See "1/10 remaining"
4. Make 10th request â†’ Still works
5. Try 11th â†’ Modal appears: "Add API key"

### 4. Test Own Key
1. Add valid API key
2. Make unlimited requests
3. Close browser â†’ Key expires
4. Reopen â†’ Back to free tier

---

## Quick Checks

âœ… Onboarding says "10 total" not "per hour"  
âœ… Dashboard shows "total lifetime limit"  
âœ… Conversation banner says "Total lifetime limit"  
âœ… After 10 requests, no reset time shown  
âœ… Modal says "Add API key to continue" (no wait time)  
âœ… Responses are faster (Haiku)

---

## Model Verification

All three places updated:
1. âœ… Main API endpoint: `claude-3-5-haiku-20241022`
2. âœ… Validation endpoint: `claude-3-5-haiku-20241022`  
3. âœ… Frontend request: `claude-3-5-haiku-20241022`

---

## Environment Variables

### Development (.env)
```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_free_tier_api_key_here
PORT=3001
```

### Production (Render)
Set in Render environment variables:
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`: (same key)
- `PORT`: (auto-assigned)
